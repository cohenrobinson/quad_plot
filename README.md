# quad_plot
Allows the user to create a quadratic function of own choosing

When run, quad_plot prompts the user to enter in values for a, b, c of a quadratic function given by ax^2 + bx + c.
Once these values have been given, the user is then required to enter a value for maximum x.

The executable then iterates over integer values for x, until max x is reached.
Each value for the quadratic function is then exported to quadratic.dat which the user can then plot using a program of choosing (i.e. gnuplot).

Further versions of the function will have plotting inbuilt to the executable.
